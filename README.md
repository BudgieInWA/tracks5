# tracks

*TLDR,* this is a `react-create-app` app.

- `yarn start` - run in development mode
- `yarn test` - run tests

# Misc TODO

Game 

- Split TrackNetwork and wrap edges in TrackSegment or something
    - make trains navigate forward

Engine
- right click and keyboard business
    - right click / esc - cancel / back
    - `\`` - debug console
- Look like unexplored map.
- find a transitiiiion-stable description of train positions so they can be css animated.
